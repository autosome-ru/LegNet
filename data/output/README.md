This folder contains [scripts](../../scripts/) outputs used for obtaining paper results. 

[complex_Drift.txt](complex_Drift.txt)/[complex_Native.txt](complex_Native.txt) and [defined_Drift.txt](defined_Drift.txt)/[defined_Native.txt]defined_Native.txt files contains expression predictions for native and drift-designed promoters in corresponding media. These files are generated by prediction scripts for [complex](../../scripts/paper/run_complex_base_model_300_predict2022.sh) and [defined](../../scripts/paper/run_defined_base_model_150_predict2022.sh) media.

[Variant processing script](../../scripts/paper/variants/make_variants_file.py) is aimed to perform the preprocessing of open-source files which results in [complex_medium_drift_res.tsv](complex_medium_drift_res.tsv) and [defined_medium_drift_res.tsv](defined_medium_drift_res.tsv) files. Based on these outputs, the [next script](../../scripts/paper/variants/run_defined_and_complex_predict_variants.sh) runs the model predictions pipeline and saves predicted values to [drift_original_complex.txt](drift_original_complex.txt) and [drift_original_defined.txt](drift_original_defined.txt) files. The [next script](../../scripts/paper/variants/make_full_variants_file.py) combines ground truth and predicted values by updating [complex_medium_drift_res.tsv](complex_medium_drift_res.tsv) and [defined_medium_drift_res.tsv](defined_medium_drift_res.tsv) files.
